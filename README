A repository for tracking, sharing and opening source code developed for the Android Developer Group, a part of Enigma of Østfold Community College.

My personal results from the Enigma Android developer challenge will be published here as examples for people to read and develop further.

Visit http://enigma.hiof.no/forumdisplay.php?4-Android for the groups forum (Norwegian).
